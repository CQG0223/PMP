# PMP(Phase Measurement Profilometry)
----
## Introduction
This repository is a python implementation of "phase shift method + multi-frequency heterodyne" in the traditional PMP method. The image data in the './data' is collected by a "binocular camera + single projector". The projector projects 3 frequency fringe images separately, and each frequency fringe image projects 4 phase-shift fringes, so each camera acquires 12 images.
